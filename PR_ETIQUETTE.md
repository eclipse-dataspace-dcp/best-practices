# Etiquette for Pull Requests

## As a contributor

Submitting pull requests should be done while adhering to a couple of simple rules.

- Familiarize yourself with our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Before you submit a PR, open a [discussion](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/dsp_best_practices/discussions/new) or an [issue](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/dsp_best_practices/issues/new) outlining your planned work and give people time to comment. It may even be advisable to contact committers using the `@mention` feature. Unsolicited PRs may get ignored or rejected.
- Create focused PRs: Your work should focus on one feature or bugfix. Do not create broad-scoped PRs that solve multiple issues, as reviewers may reject those PR bombs outright.
- Provide a clear description and motivation in the PR description in GitHub. This makes the reviewer's life much easier. It is also helpful to outline the broad changes that were made.
- All tests should be green, especially when your PR is in `"Ready for review"`
- Mark PRs as `"Ready for review"` only when you're prepared to defend your work. By then, you have completed your work and shouldn't need to push any more commits other than to incorporate review comments.
- Merge conflicts should be resolved by rebasing onto `main` and force-pushing. Do this when your PR is ready to review.
- If you require a reviewer's input while it's still in draft, please get in touch with the designated reviewer using the `@mention` feature and let them know what you'd like them to look at.
- Request a review from one of the [project's committers](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspace-protocol-base/who). Requesting a review from anyone else is still possible and sometimes may be advisable. Still, only committers can merge PRs, so include them early on.
- Re-request reviews after all remarks have been adopted. This helps reviewers track their work in GitHub.
- If you disagree with a committer's remarks, feel free to object and argue. Still, if no agreement is reached, you must either accept the decision or withdraw your PR.
- Be civil and objective. No foul language, insulting, or otherwise abusive language will be tolerated.
- The PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
    - The title must follow the format as `<type>(<optional scope>): <description>`.
      `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, and `test` are allowed for the `<type>`.
    - The length must be kept under 80 characters.

## As a reviewer

- Please complete reviews within five business days or delegate to another committer, removing yourself as a reviewer.
  If you have been requested as a reviewer but cannot do the review for any reason (time, lack of knowledge in a particular area, etc.), please comment on that in the PR and remove yourself as a reviewer, suggesting a stand-in.
- Don't be overly pedantic.
- Don't argue basic principles (e.g., protocol architecture).
- Don't just wave through any PR. Please take the time to look at them carefully.
- Be civil and objective. No foul language, insulting, or otherwise abusive language will be tolerated. The goal is to _encourage_ contributions.
- Committers can merge PRs with the approval of one other committer, provided there are no objections.
